## 🎯 Introduction
Our project, **Loan Defaulter Prediction**, aims to predict the
likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. By leveraging
machine learning, we analyze customer financial details, credit
history, and job information to make accurate predictions. This
helps banks minimize risk and ensure better credit decisionmaking.

## 💡 Inspiration
We identified that financial institutions face high risks
due to loan defaults, which negatively impact
profitability and financial stability. Our goal was to
create a model that helps predict defaults efficiently,
ensuring better loan approvals and risk management.

## ⚙️ What It Does
- **User Input:** Collects customer information such as loan amount, job type, credit balance, inquiries, and debt-to-income ratio.

- **Model Prediction:** Processes the input data using a trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of defaulter.

- **Prediction Result:** Displays the result indicating whether the customer is likely to defaulter or repayer the loan.

- **Performance Metrics:** Shows the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification insights to assess the reliability of the model.



## 🛠️ How We Built It

- IDE: Visual Studio Code

- Programming Language: Python

- Data Source: CSV File (Loan dataset)

- Libraries/Tools: pandas (data handling), scikit-learn, Random Forest, stats

Workflow:

      1. Load and preprocess data (EDA)
      
      2. Train machine learning model (using ML/AI)
      
      3. Make predictions on new data

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
- **Model Optimization:** Balancing false positives and false negatives while improving accuracy was challenging.

- **Data Imbalance:** Handling class imbalance in the dataset to avoid skewed predictions.

- **API Integration:** Ensuring seamless integration between the frontend, backend, and model for real-time prediction.
